difference between document and window object

1) document is an object wich is inside the window object
2)we use a document object for manipulation inside the document. 
3)The first thing that gets loaded into the browser is the window and the properties related to
 that window are stored in the window object.
4)The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser
5)By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects,
 we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.
